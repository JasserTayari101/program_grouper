1)Add categories and filtering of programs

2)add account settings.


1:Currently storing the programs on the form of a list but I want to make it in the form of categories,
so the best data structure will be dictionary/hashmap with categories as keys and a list of programs as values.

In the interface by default the user will have all programs loaded(to be changed to prompting for category), and then he will
filter them out

-Right now I did the change for programs as lists to dicts, this is easier to look up programs based on categories
when the user enters a category but Will be hard to navigate up and down in the menu since dicts are not ordered,
so might use collections.OrderedDict
